## Key Principles from Source

- "If you change URLs without a perfect redirect plan, you will lose rankings"
- Keep URL structure stable for money pages
- One-to-one redirects are best
- Never redirect everything to homepage
- Test high-traffic URLs individually
- All QA is mandatory

## LLM Enforcement Patterns

The source document explicitly defines:
- 7 LLM Blind Spots (and how to prevent them)
- STOP rules for critical failures
- DO NOT rules for forbidden actions
- Pre-flight checks
- Validation gates
- Business constants
- Critical item marking
- Output verification
- State tracking

All of these patterns have been incorporated into this brain's structure.
